# get_next_char()

> getchar will be implemented until morale improves.

No more implementing the same thing again and again just so you can grab the next character skipping whitespaces, tabs and newlines.

Simply call get_next_char() whenever you need a character, and it takes care of trimming spaces, newlines, and tabs automatically.

### Use case

Are you tired of implementing I/O operations each time you write a I/O related C program?

Fret no more my friend. 

With our function get_next_char() you do not have to re-implement it again and again.

### Returns 

Returns a character in char format excluding whitespace, tabs and newline.
